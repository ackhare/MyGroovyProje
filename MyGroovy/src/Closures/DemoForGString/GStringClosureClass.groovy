You will see that the assert fails! There are two reasons for this:
1)a GString only evaluates lazily the toString representation of values
2)the syntax ${x} in a GString does not represent a closure but an expression to $x, evaluated when the GString is created.

/*


If you need a real closure in a GString and f
or example enforce lazy evaluation of variables,
 you need to use the alternate syntax ${â†’ x} like in the fixed example:
