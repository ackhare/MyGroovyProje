def p = new Person(name: 'Norman')
def t = new Thing(name: 'Teapot')



//Then letâ€™s define a closure which fetches the name property on the delegate:

def upperCasedName = { delegate.name.toUpperCase() }


//Then by changing the delegate of the closure, you can see that the target object will change:

upperCasedName.delegate = p
println upperCasedName() == 'NORMAN'
upperCasedName.delegate = t
println upperCasedName() == 'TEAPOT'



//At this point, the behavior is not different from having a `
// variable defined in the lexical scope of the closure:

def target = p
def upperCasedNameUsingVar = { target.name.toUpperCase() }
println upperCasedNameUsingVar() == 'NORMAN'


/*
However there is are major differences:
in the last example, target is a local variable referenced from within the closure
the delegate can be used transparently,
that is to say without prefixing method calls with delegate. as explained in the next paragraph.
